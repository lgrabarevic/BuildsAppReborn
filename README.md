Build Monitor for TFS 2017, 2018 and Visual Studio Team Systems

As of Visual Studio version 2017 there is no Build Monitor application provided from Microsoft like it used to be. This tool is compatible with the new TFS build system and aims to provide the at least same features as the old BuildsApp from Microsoft.
There are some enhancements in the user experience and it also supports Visual Studio Team Systems.
